        <p>[Content note: Largely cannibalised from Stephan Guyenet&#8217;s <em>The Hungry Brain</em>, by far the most helpful and persuasive source on diet and obesity I&#8217;ve yet encountered. If you can, just go read the book now. If not, read Scott Alexander&#8217;s review. I am not a dietician, or a diet coach, or a nutritionist, though the latter two categories are probably not great sources of advice anyway. This has worked for me so far, and it might work for you, but confidence&nbsp;]</p>
<p>Being overweight is bad for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>But losing weight is really hard. Your body has various systems set up to make sure you&#8217;re not at risk of starvation, and those systems are <em>very insistent</em> that you maintain whatever weight level they&#8217;ve decided is the right one for you. To quote Guyenet at&nbsp;length:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hypothalamus doesn&#8217;t care what you look like in a bathing suit next summer, and it doesn&#8217;t care about your risk of developing diabetes in ten years. Its job is to keep your energy balance sheet in the black, and it takes that task very seriously [&#8230;]. The tools at its disposal, including hunger, increased food reward, and slowing your metabolic weight, are extremely persuasive. When the hypothalamus squares off with the conscious, rational mind, it usually wins in the&nbsp;end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of which is to say, if your body&#8217;s anti-starvation mechanisms want you to be a certain weight, trying to punish yourself into a lower weight through portion control and other unpleasant diets will probably fail in the long run. In fact, you&#8217;ll probably <em>gain</em> weight in the long run, because most people in affluent countries&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>Calories in, calories&nbsp;in</p>
<p>The financial independence movement is a group of people who aim to achieve, well, financial independence as soon as possible, where &#8220;financial independence&#8221; is defined as the ability to live off one&#8217;s own assets without needing to work for other people. They usually advocate doing this through a combination of very hard work in early life, very modest living standards, and investing as much as possible, often 50% of one&#8217;s income or more. Crucially, reaching financial independence early as possible depends on <em>both</em> investing as much as you can <em>and</em> lowering your living standards, such that you don&#8217;t need as much money to live happily; if you can do both of these things, and you&#8217;re reasonably skilled and lucky, you can reach financial independence while still reasonably young and thenceforth only do work you <em>want</em> to&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>A key part of the financial independence mindset as I understand it (I am not an active member) is to view your money through the mindset of opportunity cost. If you spend that $100 on a fancy meal now, it&#8217;s gone (to you) forever; if you invest it, it keeps paying compound interest for the rest of your life; at, say, 5% return, that $100 will be worth $163 after 10 years and $265 after 20 years. If you have a fairly long time horizon and consider what your money could get you if invested instead of spent, a lot of nonessential purchases start to look a whole lot less attractive. To paraphrase <span class="caps">J. L.</span> Collins, to achieve financial independence, you need to think less about what your money can buy and more about what your money can&nbsp;earn.</p>
<p>All well and good, but why am I going on about financial independence in a post about&nbsp;dieting?</p>
<p>Because like money (and indeed like many things in life), the long-term, apparently unimportant knock-on effects of your diet decisions far outweigh the short term costs and&nbsp;rewards.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you have to choose whether or not to eat a piece of delicious cake. The short-term benefits of eating the delicious cake are obvious: it&#8217;s delicious. The short-term costs are also obvious: it&#8217;s a calorie bomb and will probably screw up your calorie balance for that day. Beyond some wrangling about whether what we should <em>really</em> be worrying about is calorie balance or insulin spikes or what-have-you, most approaches to dieting stop there. But the <em>most important</em> consequences of eating or not eating the cake are much more subtle and&nbsp;long-term.</p>
<p>If you eat the cake, you&#8217;ll experience concentrated food reward, which will slightly strengthen the strength of your association between reward and food and make you slightly more prone to overeat in the future. Cake is also a high-calorie-density, high-reward, high-fat, low-protein, low-fibre food, so is basically optimised to be as unsatiating as possible for its calorie content; this means you will eat more later in the day than if you&#8217;d taken in the same number of calories as satiating foods, slightly increasing the amount of food you are habituated to eating. <em>And</em>, by habituating yourself to intensely rewarding foods, you will slightly decrease the amount of pleasure you get from healthier foods that are still tastely, but less intensely rewarding, shifting your food habits slightly towards less healthy&nbsp;foods.</p>
<p>These marginal changes to your eating habits are small on a day-to-day basis, but will accumulate inexorably over time. I doubt the rate of accumulation is the exponential growth of compound interest (otherwise a lot of people would eventually spend their entire lives guzzling oil) but I&#8217;d nevertheless claim that the long-term effects of these behavioural changes <em>far</em> exceed the one-off calorie shock of actually eating the thing. So not only is that fancy dinner far more expensive than it seems in terms of money; it&#8217;s far more expensive than it seems in terms of your long-term weight as&nbsp;well.</p>
<h2>Cashing it&nbsp;out</h2>
<p>The above is a quick sketch of my reasoning for how I&#8217;ve come to think about eating, at least as far as weight loss and weight maintenance is concerned<sup id="fnref:concerned"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:concerned">2</a></sup>. The short-term calorie content of the food you consume is relatively unimportant; what matters is its long-term effects on your eating habits, and hence how easy it is to eat a healthy, weight-controlling diet in the&nbsp;future. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eat to maximise satiety.</strong> Here I basically follow Guyenet&#8217;s list. Try to get at least 2g of protein per kilo of body weight<sup id="fnref:pounds"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:pounds">3</a></sup> per day. Avoid fat, simple carbs, and high calorie densities. Protein, fibre and bulk are your&nbsp;friends.</li>
<li><strong>Be wary of food reward.</strong> The more intensely rewarding (which mostly means high-fat and -sugar) food you eat, the more your taste buds will expect next time [<span class="caps">TODO</span>: Link to Hedonic treatmill here and elsewhere], so a diet that&#8217;s high is high-reward foods won&#8217;t actually be that much more pleasurable in the long run. Try to eat simple foods that are less intensely rewarding, but still tasty; your palate will adjust in time, and you will be much less prone to overeat. This is both good weight-control advice <em>and</em> good positive-living advice, so you owe me double for that&nbsp;one.</li>
<li><strong>Eat in terms of habits.</strong> This is touching on something of a more general life philosophy that I should cash out more at some point, but the general form of the above two dicta is to think of your eating choices in terms of their effects on your future eating habits. When I go for the chickpea salad instead of the egg sandwich at the train station, I&#8217;m (hopefully) increasing the chance that I&#8217;ll do similar in the&nbsp;future.</li>
<li><strong>Beware the buffet effect.</strong> The co-conspirator of food reward is food variety, and the co-conspirator of food cravings is sense-specific satiety. Increasing the diversity of flavours you eat together can increase your calorie intake as much as &#8230; [<span class="caps">TODO</span>: Find a number]%. So watch out for opportunities to eat very many diverse foodstuffs in one meal. You don&#8217;t have to just eat uniform meal replacement shakes (though if you like those they&#8217;re a great solution to this and other problems), but again, try to keep your meals&nbsp;simple.</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking personally, I find the framework of optimising my future self&#8217;s eating habits far more motivating and effective for watching what I eat than the traditional, more short-term justification for dieting I usually see. If you think it might work for you too, you&#8217;re very welcome to steal my framework. If not, you&#8217;re also more than welcome to cannibalise it for those parts you think might be useful and discard the rest â though I do still think you should read <em>The Hungry Brain</em>.</p>
<h2>Epilogue: On reward and&nbsp;punishment</h2>
<p>One final thing before I close. Isn&#8217;t this approach to dieting a bit, well, depressing? Avoid rewarding foods, avoid food variety, keep your food simple and satiating&#8230;this sounds like it could give rise to a very bland and uninspiring diet, and for the foodies amongst you might sound like you&#8217;d be giving up one of life&#8217;s great sources of&nbsp;joy.</p>
<p>The first thing I want to say is that I think there is some truth to this critique. It would be great if we could all eat what we wanted at any time and maximise our food reward, and I hope that, in the future, technology will make that dream possible. The world where we have to worry about the long-term ramifications of indulging in food reward is worse than the world where we can focus on maximising the pleasure we get from our diets. But we have to deal with the world we live in now, and in that world, many of us have to live otherwise than we might like to keep our weight under&nbsp;control. </p>
<p>Given that we can&#8217;t â yet â avoid the unwanted ramifications of the food we eat, how can we eat so as to maximise joy? The answer depends in part on how much pleasure you get from food, how good your default diet habits already are, and your beliefs about micronutrients and such, but in general I think a future-habit-oriented behavioural approach to dieting is both more effective and less punishing than most other approaches I&#8217;ve&nbsp;encountered.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already alluded to the other part of my answer: the hedonic treadmill. There is a reason the Epicureans, with their goal of maximising lifetime pleasure, prescribed simple living and a simple diet. The less saturated your daily diet is with intense food reward, the more you will be able to appreciate the tastiness of the food you do eat. Because of this, the aggregate loss of pleasure you get from scaling back on food reward is likely to be less than it seems from the perspective of your present&nbsp;preferences.</p>
<p>There are probably other criticisms of my approach; I&#8217;m happy to hear them. Like I said at the top, I&#8217;m not in any way an expert on this. But what I&#8217;ve said here meshes well not only with my limited knowledge of human nutrition and diet, but also with my slightly-less-limited knowledge of human psychology and rationality. It seems to have worked for me so&nbsp;far.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re working on the other thing, the someday-we&#8217;ll-be-able-to-eat-whatever-we-want-thanks-to-technology thing, I&#8217;m totally down with that as&nbsp;well.</p>

<p>Thankfully for our example, though not for your waistline, cake is high in both fat and carbs, and is therefore both optimally delicious and pessimally unhealthy regardless of what side you take in the Calorie Wars.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:costs" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
