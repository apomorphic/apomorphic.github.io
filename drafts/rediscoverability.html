        <p>A crucial consideration when evaluating how to deal with a potential information hazard is the rediscoverability of the information in question: how likely is it that someone else will soon (or already has) discovered the same information? Compared to other crucial considerations affecting info hazard management, rediscoverability is tricky in that it doesn&#8217;t always seem to militate in the same direction in terms of how open to be with the information; whereas lower containability will generally mean you should be less open with the information, and greater concentration of harm will generall suggest you shouldn&#8217;t worry as much about sharing the information, greater rediscoverability can push you towards being either more or less open depending on the&nbsp;circumstances.</p>
<p>Some key factors influencing how you should incorporate the possibility of rediscovery into your info hazard management strategy might include:
 - The estimated rate of independent rediscovery of the information (<span class="caps">NB</span>: this can also extend into the past)
 - The degree to which hypothetical rediscoverers will differ from you in how open they think you should be with the information
 - The degree to which these rediscoveres will differ from you in terms of their <em>ranking</em> of who to inform about the information (i.e. who they think it would be best to inform about the information, vs who it would be dangerous to inform)
 - How competent you judge the rediscoverers to be at&nbsp;identifying</p>
<p>[<span class="caps">NB</span>: This is from a purely informational perspective, so neglecting what the actors themselves might do with the&nbsp;information]</p>
<h2>Agree on ranking, agree on&nbsp;openness</h2>
<p>If a rediscoverer closely agrees with you about both openness and ranking, it seems at first glance like this shouldn&#8217;t have much effect on your decisionmaking; all of you will make roughly the same decision about who to inform, so the reach of the information resulting from all your openness decisions will be similar to what it would be if only you had possession of the&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>This situation seems most likely to occur in cases where you and the rediscoverers are part of the same relatively tight-knit community; you may know each other, or at the very least know the same group of people, and be fairly closely aligned on values. It is likely in this case that the rediscoverers will either be included in the group of people you tell about the information or be close to being in that group (perhaps they would be in that group if you knew they&nbsp;existed).</p>
<p>There may be possibilities for acausal trade here if you and the rediscoverers are sufficiently smart and believe in acausal trade<sup id="fnref:acausal"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:acausal">1</a></sup>. This might be a fruitful thing to dig deeper into at some&nbsp;point.</p>
<h2>Agree on ranking, disagree on&nbsp;openness</h2>
<p>In this case, a hypothetical rediscoverer would probably broadly agree with you about who it is best vs least good to tell about the information, but disagree with you about how far down that ranking to go when deciding who to inform. They might be significantly more cautious than you, or they might be significantly less cautious and spread the information much more&nbsp;widely.</p>
<p>[<span class="caps">TODO</span>: Read The Unilateralist&#8217;s&nbsp;Curse]</p>
<p>If you believe that most rediscoverers are likely to be more open than you with the information, then greater rates of rediscovery should make you less open with the information than you otherwise would be. The rediscoverers <em>ex hypothesi</em> share your ranking of who would be best to tell about the information, so you can safely assume that everyone you would tell about the informatioun would be told anyway, along with many people you would not tell. The only costs to being less open with the information now seem to&nbsp;be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some delay before the rediscoverer discovers the information and tells the people you would otherwise tell; the higher the rate of rediscovery, the smaller this delay, and the less this&nbsp;matters.</li>
<li>Any personal benefits that would accrue to you specifically from being the one to share the information: publications, monetary gains, a reputation for being smart or creative, reciprocal obligations to be informed of other things later, etc. It may be genuinely better for the world for these to accrue to you than to other, less cautious actors, so this might be a significant countervailing consideration, though probably only a dominant one if you think the risks caused by wide sharing of the information are&nbsp;small.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe that most rediscoverers are likely to be more cautious than you with the information, then at first glance this shouldn&#8217;t make much difference to how open you are with it, since you believe it&#8217;s better to be more open and they (again <em>ex hypothesi</em>) share your ranking of who best to inform and so wouldn&#8217;t inform anyone extra. However, if you think you would have a high opinion of the judgement of these more-cautious rediscoverers, you should take their (hypothetical) opinion into account and yourself be more cautious than you otherwise would. This might lead to the paradoxical result that a higher rediscovery rate should lead you to&nbsp;b</p>
<p>There are important anthropic/Unilateralist&#8217;s-Curse considerations here as well; if the rediscovery rate for a piece of information you&#8217;ve discovered seems high, you should assume that others have already discovered the information; moreover, the fact that nobody has told <em>you</em> about it suggests that these &#8220;prediscoverers&#8221; are being sufficiently cautious with the information that it hasn&#8217;t yet reached you. Depending on the field and the information, this might be good evidence for the existence of some number of more-cautious-than-you prediscoverers, which should militate in favour of you being more cautious with the information that it otherwise would (though not necessarily as cautious as&nbsp;them).</p>
<p>[<span class="caps">TODO</span>: Talk about&nbsp;co-option]</p>
<p>So overall, it seems to me like a high inferred rate of rediscovery by people who share your inform ranking (<span class="caps">TODO</span>: Better term for this) but differ in their preferred level of openness should cause you to be less open with the information, whether or not the inferred rediscoverers tend to be more or less open than you. The greater the deviation in openness, and the higher the rate of rediscovery, the less open you should be. If there are large selfish benefits that would accrue to you for being the one to spread the information, and the risks of spreading it are fairly small, this may <em>sometimes</em> be enough to counterbalance this trend to at least some extent<sup id="fnref:selfish"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:selfish">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>[<span class="caps">NB</span>: Also need to account for past vs future rediscoverers; if conditions have recently changed so as to increase the rediscovery rate you might actually be earlier on in the discovery chain than it seems; though, you might want to collaborate with future rediscoverers&nbsp;anyway.]</p>
<h2>Disagree on&nbsp;ranking</h2>
<p>Rediscoverers will often differ from you in their reach ranking, i.e. the ordering of how good or bad they think it would be for a given person to know or not know the information. At the most basic level, they will probably just know about a different set of people from you, and so have a better idea of how good or bad it would be for those people to know the information and a worse idea of how good or bad it would be for the people <em>you</em> know to know it. I&#8217;m not sure this kind of ranking difference matters that much: we can postulate a kind of <span class="caps">CEV</span>-like &#8220;ideal ranking&#8221; that you would both have if you could vet everyone in the world, and if <em>these</em> rankings are similar I think the problem more-or-less reduces to the previous&nbsp;case.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the rediscoverer disagrees with you about rankings, but is highly open, then there&#8217;s a good chance the information will reach the people you&#8217;d want it to reach anyway; at the very leash, it would hopefully reach someone who shares a similar ranking to you, who could then inform the people you would most want to learn the information. As a general rule, it seems like the reach ranking an individual has matters less and less the more open they are. Hence, a higher rate of rediscovery by individuals with different reach rankings but high openness also seems to militate in favour of less openness on your&nbsp;part.</p>
<p>The tricky case, then, is when you estimate a high rate of rediscovery by actors who both differ from you in reach ranking, who would also show low openness with regard to the information in question. In this case, people you don&#8217;t want to know the information will be learning the information, while people you do want learning the information will not be. Depending on the gulf between your reach ranking and theirs, this might make it especially important that the people you want to know the information know it, so they can act to counteract whatever the people you wouldn&#8217;t want to know the information are now doing with it. This is the classic cybersecurity case: if the bad hackers have uncovered a serious security flaw, or will soon, it&#8217;s very important that the good, pro-security hackers also know about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>How should this situation affect your openness decision? Returning to my earlier terminology, it definitely increases the concealment hazard of the information; as the rediscovery rate by non-aligned actors increases, it becomes more and more important that those people best able to deal with the situation know about the danger. It also seems likely to decrease the benefit concentration; that is, there are likely to be more people it is important to inform in a high-rediscovery adversarial situation than in a low-rediscovery one. Both of these effects will militate in favour of somewhat more openness than would otherwise be the case. The magnitude of this effect, however, seems likely to be field-specific and hard to parameterise: in some cases you might want the problem to be broadcast to a whole community of people working to fix this and related problems, while in others it might be especially important to inform a few select&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>In any case, it&#8217;s important to note that this should probably only increase your openness if you think nonaligned actors (i.e. those with a very different reach ranking from yours) are likely to be <em>enriched</em> among the set of possible rediscoverers, such that they are likely to rediscover it (or have already rediscovered it)

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In general, therefore, it seems like a higher rediscovery rate should militate in favour of less openness on your part, both because less-cautious rediscoverers will often spread the information at least as widely as you otherwise would, and out of respect for the opinions of inferred more-cautious rediscoverers of the past and future. However, in a highly adversarial context, higher rediscovery rates may militate in favour of more openness, to increase the probability that aligned actors are able to counteract the effect of

<p>[<span class="caps">NB</span> Linch raises the point that it&#8217;s also important to consider how easy it would be for less-competent more-open actors to either frame the information badly or publish similar, perhaps easier ideas that poison the well. This seems to add a third dimension of how easy it is to mess up explaining the idea / how close it is to other, harmfully-similar ideas that are easier to discover and&nbsp;spread.]</p>
