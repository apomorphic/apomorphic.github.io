        <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen">pathogen</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism">parasite</a> that causes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease">disease</a>. They are everywhere: in the air, in the water, in the soil, in plants, in animals, in each other. Very few are pathogens of humans: almost all cause disease in some other creature, and have no aptitude for living on or inside human bodies. Usually, we move through this omnipresent sea of others&#8217; pathogens without taking much notice. But occasionally, ill-fatedly, a disease <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spillover_infection">spills over</a>, and becomes a disease of&nbsp;humanity.</p>
<p>David Quammen&#8217;s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17573681-spillover"><em>Spillover</em></a> is a big book about a big subject: zoonotic diseases, those that have spilled over from animals into humans. The book functions as a kind of Greatest Hits of modern zoonotic diseases: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henipavirus#Hendra_virus">Hendra</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebolavirus">Ebola</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marburg_virus">Marburg</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome-related_coronavirus"><span class="caps">SARS</span></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henipavirus#Nipah_virus">Nipah</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_fever">Q fever</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease">Lyme disease</a>, zoonotic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_knowlesi">malaria</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"><span class="caps">HIV</span></a> all get their time in the sun. It&#8217;s worth reading the book for their individual stories alone, but the key thread running throughout the book, that I plan to tease out here, is the concept of spillover itself: when, why and how diseases leap from animals to humans; what kinds of pathogens and reservoirs seem particularly prone to causing spillover; and how, if at all, we can predict where it will happen next. If you have a background in pathology or public health then little of this will be new to you; if not, you might learn something&nbsp;interesting.</p>
<p>This is an (un)fortuitous time to be reviewing this book: as I write this, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-nCoV">new zoonotic virus</a> is spreading across China, and health authorities there and across the world are fighting to prevent a new global pandemic. It&#8217;s a sobering reminder of the awesome power of these tiny organisms and, perhaps, a good opportunity to learn more about the processes underlying this and so many other health&nbsp;emergencies.</p>
<h2>Reservoirs and&nbsp;amplifiers</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the&nbsp;sun.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+1%3A9&amp;version=KJV">Ecclesiastes 1:9 <span class="caps">KJV</span></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything comes from somewhere. Every human pathogen was once something else. Some have been with us since the dawn of our species. Others come to us from the environment, adapting rapidly to their new role as disease-causing agents. But most come to us from other&nbsp;animals.</p>
<p>The population of organisms in which a pathogen &#8220;naturally&#8221; lives and reproduces is known as its <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_reservoir">reservoir</a></em>. The relationship between a pathogen and its reservoir is often very ancient, and each has evolved to adapt to the presence of the other. This often means the reservoir host suffers little to no illness due to the presence of the pathogen, though this is far from always the case, and depends on the nature of the host, the pathogen, and their ecological&nbsp;relationship. </p>
<p>As it goes about its life, the reservoir host will sometimes encounter other animals, and sometimes these encounters will result in the pathogen getting inside those other animals. This can happen a number of ways: perhaps the new host is exposed to the excreta of the reservoir host, or eats food that was partly eaten by the reservoir host, or eats the reservoir host itself. Depending on the pathogen, breathing the same air as the reservoir could be sufficient. Regardless, it happens, and the pathogen ends up inside a potential host of a new&nbsp;species.</p>
<p>The pathogen is now in a strange new environment: a different species, with different physiology and a different metabolism and an immune system that is <em>very upset</em> about its presence. It is not adapted to this new environment, and most of the time it will fail to colonise it: it will die off of its own accord, or be eliminated by the host&#8217;s immune system, and that will be that. Occasionally, though, the pathogen will get lucky: it is adapted <em>enough</em> to the new environment to survive and proliferate, overwhelming the host&#8217;s immune system and causing disease. Given time, it evolves to become ever-more-adapted to its new host, ever-more-comfortable in its new surroundings. If it is <em>very</em> lucky, the result is not an isolated outbreak but a sustained epidemic<sup id="fnref:epidemic"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:epidemic">1</a></sup>, in which the disease spreads widely in the new host population and, perhaps, becomes a long-term, endemic disease of that&nbsp;species.</p>
<p>What constitutes &#8220;lucky&#8221; here? One thing that definitely helps is for the new host to be evolutionarily close and physiologically similar to the old one; the less different the environment, the greater the chance that the pathogen can survive there. For example, pathogens that are already adapted to warm-blooded hosts have an easier time infecting other warm-blooded animals than those with cold-blooded reservoirs. A larger dose of the pathogen also helps: the more of the new pathogen the immune system has to deal with at once, the less likely it can suppress the infection&nbsp;quickly. </p>
<p>Sometimes, a disease is incapable of spilling over directly from its reservoir into humans; the minimum infectious dose of the pathogen is too high, the amount of pathogen shed by the reservoir too small. In these cases, the gap between reservoir and human must be bridged by an <em>amplifier</em>: some other nonhuman animal that <em>can</em> be infected by the reservoir, and in which the pathogen replicates so successfully that it can overcome barriers to infection in other, more resistant species present nearby<sup id="fnref:compromised"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:compromised">2</a></sup>. In Australia, for example, humans that interact with infected bats on a daily basis never seem to catch Hendra virus, but humans that interact with horses in proximity to bats <em>do</em>; the horses catch the virus from the horses, get very sick, and provide the high viral loads required to infect humans. To be an amplifier is an unfortunate fate: you suffer extravagently, and in so doing infect more resistant creatures around&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Identifying the reservoir (and, if applicable, the amplifiers) is an important part of disease ecology, especially in the event of a serious outbreak: find the reservoir, and you know how, and how much, you can minimise the risk. If it&#8217;s a domestic animal, it can be culled or vaccinated; if a wild animal, steps can be taken to minimise contact with humans and domestics. Eradication can be a tall order, but if you know the reservoir you can start to whittle down the spillover rate. Conversely, if you don&#8217;t know the reservoir, you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on: where and how the spillover occurred, or how to prevent it from happening&nbsp;again.</p>
<h2>On bats and&nbsp;viruses</h2>
<p>The reservoir species of human zoonotic diseases vary, but there are clear patterns. Most zoonotic diseases of humans spill over from other mammalian species, and most of the rest spill over from birds. Quite a few diseases (yellow fever, zoonotic malaria, <span class="caps">HIV</span>&#8230;) reside in other primates; given their evolutionary proximity to us this isn&#8217;t so surprising. Abundant, ubiquitous and mammalian, rodents also make good reservoirs for human zoonoses (plague, Lyme disease, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagas_disease">Chagas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_Nombre_orthohantavirus">Sin Nombre</a><sup id="fnref:sinnombre"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sinnombre">4</a></sup>&#8230;). But the clear standout reservoirs for recent zoonotic outbreaks are definitely&nbsp;bats.</p>
<p>The list of recent zoonoses with bats as their confirmed or suspected reservoir is <em>long</em><sup id="fnref:long"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:long">5</a></sup>. What makes them so good at spreading diseases? This has been a topic of interest in epidemiology for a few years now, and several possible answers have been proposed. The most basic are demographic and ecological: bats can fly (which makes them good at spreading diseases over a wide area) and live in very large, dense colonies (in which infections can spread rapidly to very many individuals). Bats also tend to be long-lived, so one infected bat can keep flying around transmitting its pathogens for a long time. They are also <em>very</em> diverse: about 25% of all mammalian species are bats, so just as a prior we&#8217;d expect them to collectively harbour a lot of different viruses <sup id="fnref:harbour"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:harbour">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Bats&#8217; eating habits have also come in for criticism. Many large bats eat fruit, and when doing so they often chew and spit out partially-digested fruit remnants. Other animals can then eat this fruit, get infected from bat saliva, and pass the infection on to humans<sup id="fnref:dobson2005"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dobson2005">7</a></sup>. Smaller bats echolocate, and in doing so create high-frequency vibrations that aerosolise their saliva, wafting pathogens down in a fine mist<sup id="fnref:han2015"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:han2015">8</a></sup>. When bats nest in trees rather than caves, animals living below them can be exposed not just to saliva-laced fruit but also excreta, which can also spread infection. When bats <em>do</em> live in caves, humans seem to have a mysterious habit of visiting, clambering around and gawping at them, which also provides plenty of scope for&nbsp;transmission.</p>
<p>Probably the most interesting explanations for why bats are so dangerous, though, have to do with their&nbsp;immunology&#8230;</p>
<h2>stuff</h2>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Ecological disturbance causes diseases to emerge. Shake a tree, and things fall&nbsp;out.&#8221;</p>
<p>So now we have a story. A pathogen lives in uneasy symbiosis with its reservoir host: sometimes peacefully tolerated, other times merely not deadly enough to cause its own extinction. At some point, during the process of transmission, the pathogen finds itself in a new environment, a new species. Usually it fails to adapt and dies, either due to the sheer unfamiliarity of the environment or with the active assistance of the new host&#8217;s immune system. Occasionally such an interloper gets lucky and finds a new home it can thrive in – or at least, survive long enough for some of its population to find the key adaptations needed to thrive. Good news for the pathogen, very bad news for the host. Especially bad news if the host is a&nbsp;human.</p>
<p>A spillover has occurred. What happens next depends on the pathogen, the host and the circumstances. There might be a sudden explosive, localised outbreak, as seen so many times with Ebola: terrifying, easy to spot and (if you&#8217;re lucky) relatively easy to contain. This is the pattern often followed by Ebola and once (so far) by <span class="caps">SARS</span>. </p>
<p>In other cases, the pathogen is more subtle, each new case infecting only a few (perhaps even only one) new cases on average. Death comes slowly and/or rarely, often attributed to some other cause. Many such slow spillovers die out before they reach a wider &#8220;audience&#8221; [<span class="caps">NB</span>: different word]; a few hang on, one or a few infections at a time, until they find themselves in more (in)salubrious circumstances, their <span class="math">\(R_0\)</span> rises, and they start spreading in a big&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>As Quammen tells it, this is the story of <span class="caps">HIV</span>: an early spillover around 1905; a prolongued period of slow, small-scale transmission in the rural Congo, eventually finding its way to Kinshasa; an explosion amongst the rapid human population growth and relaxed sexual mores of the mid-20th century; gradual spread across Africa and (via Haiti) the rest of the world; and an eventual explosion into prominance in the developed world. It might also be the story of 2019-nCoV; time will&nbsp;tell.</p>
<p>The 20th century has seen a lot of scary spillovers. Again and again, more and more new diseases have emerged into the public-health limelight: Ebola, Marburg, Hendra, <span class="caps">HIV</span>, West Nile, Rift Valley, chikungunya, Nipah, Siu Nombre, Lassa, Q-fever, Machupo, <span class="caps">SARS</span>, <span class="caps">MERS</span>&#8230;and most recently, this new coronavirus that may or may not be brought under&nbsp;control.</p>
<p>These diseases are multifarious, but they have some things in common. They&#8217;re usually (but not always) single-stranded <span class="caps">RNA</span> viruses. They&#8217;re often (but not always) carried by bats. They&#8217;re mostly (but not always) endemic to hot, poor, tropical countries. And they all (probably) spilled over into humans at some point in the 20th&nbsp;century.</p>
<p>Quammen claims that this roster of zoonoses is part of a pattern, an accelerating drumbeat of threats caused not by bad luck but by human activity. As development marches on, we&#8217;ve been making ever-greater inroads into natural former-wilderness, disrupting habitats, destroying hiding places and occupying the land for ourselves and our various domesticates. In some places, we&#8217;ve also been eating quite a few of the animals we encounter in the&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>We thus give the many pathogens residing in these forest species ample chance to infect our food sources and, directly or indirectly, to infect us. Most fail, but each of those that succeed gets a chance to adapt, make itself at home, and take advantage of the world&#8217;s most powerful transmission system: our global transportation network. So far, out of the new zoonoses, only <span class="caps">HIV</span> and swine flu have truly conquered the world, but it&#8217;s only matter of time until the Next Big One follows them to glory— I mean, massive reproductive&nbsp;success.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an arresting claim. Is it&nbsp;true?</p>
<p>Quammen cites a study claiming that roughly three-quarters of emerging pathogens are zoonotic, and another claiming that about 60% are (he claims these numbers are similar, which confused me a little, but regardless – a lot of&nbsp;zoonoses)</p>
<p>[check these studies - p.&nbsp;49]</p>
<h2>Consequences for public&nbsp;health</h2>
<p>Zoonotic pathogens aren&#8217;t just unpredictable; they&#8217;re also hard to eradicate. The reason we&#8217;ve been able to eradicate smallpox, nearly eradicate polio, and talk about eradicating measles, is that these diseases aren&#8217;t zoonoses: they exist only in humans, and if they are eradicated in humans they are eradicated everywhere. Diseases with animal vectors, like malaria and other mosquito-borne conditions, are much harder to eradicate (since it&#8217;s much more difficult to isolate infected cases) but it&#8217;s conceivable that we could one-day extirpate these diseases too; like smallpox, if falciparum malaria is eliminated in humans, it&#8217;s eliminated&nbsp;everywhere.</p>
<p>Zoonotic diseases represent a vastly more difficult case, because you can&#8217;t just eradicate the disease in humans: if you do, it&#8217;ll just spill over again from the reservoir species, in some unpredictable place at some unpredictable time, and start the cycle anew. You can try to cull the reservoir species, vaccinate them, or limit their interactions with humans; but all of these are to varying degrees expensive, difficult, controversial, and prone to unintended ecological or economic consequences. Typically, the best you can hope for is to keep the disease suppressed, the risk of human exposure low. And even then, there&#8217;s always another nasty zoonosis waiting around the corner for the next big&nbsp;opportunity.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts on the actual&nbsp;book</h2>
<p>So far I&#8217;ve focused on what I think are the key ideas in the book that someone might want to know. What do I think of the book&nbsp;itself?</p>
<p>I enjoyed it a lot. I&#8217;d never heard of David Quammen before, and was pleasantly surprised. Like a lot of general nonfiction it&#8217;s somewhat overwritten by my tastes, but not egregiously so. He gives a good account of the ebbs and flows of scientific discovery, does a good job communicating the essence of mathematical disease ecology, and seems very good at getting in-depth interviews with important people.&nbsp;[?]</p>
<p>I attended a biosecurity conference (<span class="caps">ASM</span> Biothreats) shortly after reading this book, and felt that [&#8230;]
[Did it match current understanding? Did it leave me feeling better&nbsp;prepared?]</p>
<p>As an accessible introduction to the natural-pandemics side of the biosecurity space, I don&#8217;t think you can do much&nbsp;better.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you happen to go somewhere known to harbour interesting diseases, stay away from the bats if you&nbsp;can.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more in Spillover than I&#8217;ve discussed here. There are lots of hands on stories of different emergent diseases, some of them very dramatic. There&#8217;s some interesting cultural-evolution stuff about the supernatural beliefs people have built up around epidemics. There&#8217;s some genuinely frightening blow-by-blow account of the <span class="caps">SARS</span> outbreak and its&nbsp;containment. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s interesting discussion the (pre-spillover) evolution and spread of&nbsp;ebolavirus, </p>

<p>Thus, if all potential reservoirs were created equal, we would expect almost as many emergent pathogens from bats as from small mammals. This is not the case; less than 2% of human pathogens have bats as natural reservoirs &#8230; These data suggest that bats are not overrepresented in the numbers of pathogens that emerge from them. What is more conspicuous is the pronounced pathology of pathogens that spill over from bats[.]<br>
