        <p>[<span class="caps">CN</span>: Wild speculation about something I know very little&nbsp;about.]</p>
<h2>I</h2>
<p><a href="www.wildanimalinitiative.org/who-we-are">Simon Eckerström Liedholm</a> is working for the Wild Animal Initiative on how to incorporate ideas about reversability and resilience when assessing potential interventions to improve wild-animal welfare. Talking to him about this, I realised I didn&#8217;t actually know what it would mean to reverse an intervention, or how to estimate how reversible an intervention might be. Thinking about this further has only left me more and more confused, and I don&#8217;t like being confused alone so I&#8217;m going to drag you all down with&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>To fully and completely reverse an action, removing all its consequences at all times and all places, is obviously impossible without time travel. A relaxed definition, in which we accept an action&#8217;s past consequences but undo all its future consequences, seems more promising at first, but is also basically impossible even in very simple cases: the actions required to reverse the original intervention are themselves consequences of that intervention, and take time, effort and resources that could otherwise have been spent on other things. Undoing <em>those</em> consequences would require further costly actions that would not otherwise have been necessary, and so&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Okay, so maybe it&#8217;s impossible to totally reverse an intervention, but was anyone claiming otherwise? Maybe <em>mostly</em> undoing the consequences of an action is enough. Sadly, the situation is actually much worse than that, because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">butterfly effects</a> that are rampant in any complex system. To use the <a href="80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/hilary-greaves-global-priorities-institute/">standard example</a>, if you slightly delay or expedite someone&#8217;s crossing the street, you&#8217;re likely to totally change the identities of huge numbers of future people; how will you reverse <em>that</em>? You can use a similar example for wild animals; if you briefly capture one insect, will anything about the forest be the same in 100 years&#8217;&nbsp;time?</p>
<p>We seem forced to conclude that virtually any intervention always changes the details of the future in indelible and often enormous ways. Yet, it does seem that people, including me, consider it both possible and sometimes desirable to partially or fully reverse at least some human actions<sup id="fnref:notyou"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:notyou">1</a></sup>. How to square this&nbsp;circle?</p>
<p>I think to understand what it might mean to &#8220;reverse&#8221; an intervention, we need to get a better sense of how people compare different states of the world. In other words, we need to know what <em>distance metric</em> people are using to determine how close two worlds are to each other. Reversal can then be defined as bringing about a world sufficiently close, according to this distance metric, to the world that would have come to be (or that we think would have come to be) had the initial intervention never been made<sup id="fnref:terminology"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:terminology">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Clearly, whatever intuitive distance metric people are using, it isn&#8217;t some fine-grained measure based on the position of atoms, or even of objects. Such a metric would probably be beyond the comptutational capacity of the human brain; it would be highly vulnerable to the kind of butterfly effects mentioned above; and even if it were feasible it wouldn&#8217;t seem to get at what humans consider important. So what are we using&nbsp;instead?</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s not the detailed state of the world that matters when evaluating the distance between world states, it seems like there must be higher-level properties that people are using to make these judgements, which they obtain by aggregating and processing the details of the world in some way. In order to be useful in assessing whether an intervention has been reversed, these properties would need to be (or at least, to seem) relatively immune to fine-grained butterfly effects; that is, they would need to be able judge worlds that differ radically in detail as similar. To do that you&#8217;re going to need to discard a lot of information about the world. So whatever higher-level properties people are using to estimate distances between possible worlds, they must be simple enough to overcome the butterfly-effect problem, but still complex enough that people still perceive lots of meaningful and subtle distinctions between world states<sup id="fnref:dimensionality"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dimensionality">3</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:abstraction"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:abstraction">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m aiming for here is not a detailed account of how people aggregate details of the world to come up with these higher-level properties, nor a fine-grained philosophical account of their nature; both of those would be way too ambitious for me to attempt here. Rather, what I&#8217;d like to find is a sketch of what <em>sort</em> of properties people are using when they deem an intervention to have been reversed or not reversed (or more vs less reversed), so I can get a better idea of how I (and those close to me in values) should think about reversibility. Is it an illusion we should take seriously only insofar as we need to predict and manage the reactions of others, or something more genuinely&nbsp;meaningful?</p>
<h2><span class="caps">II</span></h2>
<p>One plausible candidate for a higher-level world-comparison metric that I think is <em>not</em>, in the end, sufficient is morality: two possible worlds are similar if they seem equally morally desirable. Under this framing, an intervention would be reversed if the post-response world was made to be at least as morally good as the no-intervention world. An&nbsp;example:</p>
<aside><strong>Compensation</strong>: It becomes known that an action of the government harmed a certain group of people. In response, the government issues generous compensation to those people.</aside>

<p>If the compensation is sufficiently generous and the initial harm not too severe, this feels like a reversal to me, and I expect it would to others as well. However, it&#8217;s easy enough for this to go&nbsp;awry:</p>
<aside><strong>Off-target compensation:</strong> It becomes known that an action of the government harmed a certain group of people. In response, the government issues generous compensation to a different, unrelated group of people.</aside>

<p>Let&#8217;s stipulate that the compensation is large enough that the post-compensation world is just as good as the no-harm world, even though the harmed people are still harmed. I suspect very few people would consider this a meaningful reversal of the original harm. Now, sure, most people are not utilitarians<sup>[citation needed]</sup>, so for those people the post-compensation and no-harm worlds are not morally equalised in this scenario.  But I&#8217;m much more utilitarian than most people, and this still doesn&#8217;t feel like a reversal to&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>If the compensation is sufficiently generous and the harm the people experienced isn&#8217;t indelible (e.g. the loss of a loved one), this seems like it would go some way towards meaningfully reversing the&nbsp;intervention.</p>
<p>One obvious candidate is the moral value of the future: if the intervention makes the world better or worse, could an action that reverses that change in value be said to reverse the intervention? I think this is probably part of the answer, but&nbsp;it&#8217;s </p>
<p>Imagine a government takes an action that is later found to harm some specific group of people. In order to reverse the damage, the government announces it will take some action to benefit a completely different group of people. This doesn&#8217;t feel to me like reversing the intervention, and I doubt it would fly with voters&nbsp;either.</p>
<p>Maybe people <em>are</em> using the concept of reversal in this moral sense, but are just using a more complex morality system than utilitarianism? The world in which Group B is compensated for the harm done to Group A might be identical in terms of happiness and suffering to the world in which neither harm nor compensation occurs, but it differs along other plausibly-morally-relevant axes like justice and fairness. Perhaps if you found an action that would make the future just as good as if you&#8217;d never taken the action according to people&#8217;s <em>actual</em> value system, <em>then</em> they&#8217;d consider the intervention to be&nbsp;reversed.</p>
<p>Again, I think this may well be part of the answer, but it doesn&#8217;t seem sufficient. I&#8217;m unusually sympathetic to total utilitarianism and unusually unsympathetic to intrinsically valuing things like fairness, but the &#8220;reversal&#8221; in the example above [<span class="caps">TODO</span>: Name the scenario like a proper philosopher] doesn&#8217;t feel like a reversal to me. In addition, I suspect that for almost any plausible and explicitly definable value system under which reversal is even theoretically possible, you could find a similar example that brings about a world that&#8217;s just as good as if the original action had never been taken, but which intuitively doesn&#8217;t seem like it reverses that action<sup id="fnref:disagree"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:disagree">5</a></sup>. This is hardly a proof, but it just feels to me like the question of &#8220;has this action been reversed&#8221; feels different from the question of &#8220;is the world now as good as it would have been had the action not been&nbsp;taken&#8221;.</p>
<p>[<span class="caps">TODO</span>: Link yudkowsky, try to come up with a couple more examples for e.g. justice, fairness,&nbsp;naturalness]</p>
<p>Rather, it seems like, in addition to intuitions about &#8220;undoing the damage&#8221;, people also have intuitions that a post-reversal world should be <em>cosmetically similar</em>, in some sense, to a no-intervention world. By cosmetically similar, I mean that the world <em>appears to human senses</em> to be meaningfully similar (whatever that means) to the no-intervention world. Whatever gestalt sense of &#8220;what the world is like&#8221; humans have, the post-reversal world feels the same as the no-intervention world: it looks the same, sounds the same, smells the same, and so forth. Whatever summary metrics people might use to track aspects of the world relevant to this gestalt sense (number of trees, number of species, self-reported happiness, whatever), the two worlds have similar values on those statistics. And so&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Obviously, a strictly-reversed world in which the consequences of the intervention were abrogated would be considered successfully reversed under this criterion, as it would under the harm-compensation criterion above. But strict reversal is not required for a post-reversal world to be cosmetically similar. If you delay a fish about its business for a few seconds and thus totally change which individual fish exist in the future, you haven&#8217;t affected the number or geographic distribution of fish much, and the river probably still looks much the same as it otherwise would have, so you haven&#8217;t created a cosmetic or moral difference in the world that would need to be&nbsp;reversed. </p>

<p>Yet, it does seem that people consider it both possible and sometimes desirable to partially or fully reverse at least some of their actions, and expect others to do the same. An intervention that is &#8220;reversible&#8221; is considered preferable to, and is more likely to gain public support and traction than, one that is not. So, given that really undoing even the future consequences of any action is impossible, what are the features of an action that cause it to be regarded as fully or partially reversing another? [I&#8217;m not sure about the answer yet, but here are some possibilities (note that the specific criteria that need to be met may differ in different&nbsp;domains):]</p>

<li>The Reversal removes or undoes the obvious, predictable, near-term consequences of the Intervention (without addressing its non-obvious, unpredictable or long-term effects or taking into account the costs of doing&nbsp;so)</li>

<p>[<span class="caps">TODO</span>: I think I need to make the problem clearer]
[<span class="caps">TODO</span>: Prune, rearrange and clarify&nbsp;examples]</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s bring this back round to the question of intervening in nature. Intervening in nature in a predictable way is <em>really</em> hard. Because it&#8217;s a dynamic equilibrium with many ferociously competing forces at work, almost any extrinsic change to a natural system could cause no lasting change (the system eventually returns to its previous equilibrium), moderate change (the equilibrium is shifted somewhat) or drastic change (the system shifts to a radically different equilibrium, or collapses). Undoing an intervention to the extent that the same <em>individual</em> organisms are present that would have been otherwise is clearly impossible; the best we can hope for is that either the higher-level features (whatever those are) of the ecosystem are the same as they would have been, or that the outcome is morally equivalent to the counterfactual in some way. Depending on people&#8217;s moral beliefs, level of knowledge, and aesthetic preferences, what moral or empirical features of the ecosystem are sufficient for the intervention to count as adequately &#8220;reversed&#8221; from their perspective are likely to differ&nbsp;substantially. </p>
<p>Just a couple more examples to illustrate how hard this is:&nbsp;&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently very confused about what exactly it means to reverse an action, especially when that action was an intervention in a complex system. This confusion was initially pretty surprising to me since I didn&#8217;t realise before that the concept of reversal was so thorny. I suspect there is phisolophical literature on this but haven&#8217;t bothered to search for it, which means there&#8217;s a good chance I&#8217;m missing something important. Nevertheless, I think we can extract a couple of decent takeaways from the above&nbsp;mess.</p>
<p>The first is that anyone considering making an intervention in any complex system should be aware that that intervention is fundamentally <em>always</em> a one-time, irreversible change to that system. You will never be able to really undo what you did. This should encourage caution, small-scale experimentation, and&nbsp;&#8230;</p>
<p>The second is that the&nbsp;features </p>
<p>At the moment I think I would probably recommend thinking of &#8220;reversal&#8221; and &#8220;reversibility&#8221; mainly as <span class="caps">PR</span> exercises, and instead focus on the ability to keep the unintended consequences of your decisions as small as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>If something does go wrong, you can&#8217;t reverse it, but you can make a <em>new</em> irreversible intervention intended&nbsp;to </p>
<p>Imagine a past intervention has gone wrong, and caused bad consequences. What should you do? I would&nbsp;claim&#8230;</p>

<p>Perhaps you are an exception to this, and either already found or now find it obvious that nothing is reversible. If so, congratulations on your rationality, and I invite you to either stop reading here or treat the rest of this post as an anthropological investigation into exactly why and how other people are wrong.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:notyou" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:terminology">
<p>Going forward, I&#8217;ll refer to the world in which an intervention was made and then a reversal was attempted as the &#8220;post-response world&#8221;, in contrast to the &#8220;no-intervention world&#8221; in which no intervention was made. Consistent with this, I&#8217;ll refer to the second intervention, made in an attempt to reverse the first intervention (whatever that means), as the &#8220;response&#8221;.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:terminology" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:dimensionality">
<p>This feels like a dimensionality-reduction problem: Humans are taking en extremely complex and high-dimensional perceived world and mapping it to a much lower-dimensional conceptual space in which comparison between possible worlds is tractable. It also feels like something there&#8217;s probably a vast literature about already that it&#8217;s absurd for me not to have read before opining on this. Ah well.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:dimensionality" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:abstraction">
<p>Of course, I&#8217;m talking here as though humans have fully-realised models of possible worlds in their heads, which they are then abstracting down to some constrained set of higher-level variables they then use to make comparisons. This is obviously false: our imagination of a possible world is <em>vastly</em> less detailed than an actual world state. But I think it&#8217;s plausible that the kinds of properties people imagine about possible worlds are the same properties they abstract from (and remember about) observed states of the world, such that after doing the imagining and abstracting, the two world models can be compared. Or something.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:abstraction" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
