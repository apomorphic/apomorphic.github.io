## Stuff from me

I put up two more pieces on the EA Forum that I didn't think needed to be on this blog: a [question][disneyland] about Bostrom's "Disneyland without children" and a [followup][concrete] to my [previous post][awms] about ageing-based welfare measures with some concrete suggestions for future progress in the area.

## New stuff

Technically, much of this stuff is not actually new, but I only came across it recently and *it's my blog*.

- Lately I've been enjoying Jason Crawford's blog [Roots of Progress][rop]: "an intellectual project, which may take many years, to understand the nature and cause of human progress." Highlights include his [discussion][rop_natural] of the fundamental artificiality of "natural resources" and his public boggling at the wonders of [iron][rop_iron] and [cement][rop_cement].
- The classic story of how blind auditions reduced discrimination against women in orchestras [may not be real][orchestras].
- The Dutch have a special symbol called the [flourish of approval][flourish].
- A mole of moles [is a lot of moles][moles].
- The UK is experimenting with new ways of [paying for antibiotics][antibiotics].
- "Part of what makes us happy is the satisfaction of actually (or likely) helping people. [Consequentialism can ask us to give up even this][gambles]."
- Here's an actually-quite-old post about [Really Big Numbers][numbers]. I still don't really comprehend Graham's Number, but at least I'm starting to get an inkling of how unimaginably vast it is.

## Golden oldies

Here's some older stuff that I read a while ago, but has been on my mind for one reason or another.

- Reading Roots of Progress reminds me of Kris De Decker's [Low Tech Magazine][ltm], a great example of what happens when you take widely-but-vaguely-held ideas seriously (in this case, a certain kind of environmental pessimism). His recent posts have mostly been less interesting to me, but he has a fantastic back catalogue of posts on obsolete technology: [wood-powered cars][ltm_cars], [wind-powered factories][ltm_wind], and even [fans and food mixers powered by tap water][ltm_water]. And if you're unfamiliar with the technological marvel that is the Chinese wheelbarrow, don't miss his [magisterial summary][ltm_wheelbarrow].
- In a similar vein, remember a few years ago when everyone got very excited about [shipping containers][shipping]?
- Finally, in case you haven't seen it before, here's [a two year old's solution to the trolley problem][trolley]
